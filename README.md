# FinalProject17
The game is a scavenger hunt promposal. The player will enter their pronoun and name and their crush's name pronoun and name.
Then the story and rules will be printed. The storyline is that the player and their crush have been best friends forever and prom is 4 weeks away.
The player will ask their crush to prom. The player is planning a scavenger hunt promposal with their crush’s favorite things.
Their crush is going to go to 20 different places and if they got to at least 15 of those places, then they will be able to make it to the last place where the player will be ready to prompose.
In order to track how many questions they player got right, there will be 20 pieces of a heart. After every question answered, the number of pieces of a heart will be updated.
There will be questions with hints that will lead the player's crush to their favorite places, where they will hopefully find a piece of the heart.
The catch is: if the hints I wrote don't lead the player's crush to their favorite place, their crush won’t find a piece of the heart.
The answers I have are the actual places, the hints will cross out some of the options in the mutiple chpice, but not all of them so it is the choice of the player, what they will choose/
What the player answers will lead their crush to a specific place.
At the end they player will hopefully have enough pieces to complete their half of the heart, and you will go happily to prom with their crush.
There are 20 questions the player has to answer at least 15 right or else their crush will get lost in the scavenger hunt.

because it is a recap of everything we learned in class and if I forgot how to do some things, I used it to relearn it.
I also used https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1 to learn how to use git.
